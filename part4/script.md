### Summary
**Observability in Kubernetes: The Missing Piece for Production Readiness**

This tutorial bridges the gap between development and production-grade Kubernetes deployments by implementing comprehensive **observability** - the ability to understand what's happening inside your systems through collected data.

**What We'll Build:**
- A complete end-to-end monitoring stack for Kubernetes applications
- Real-time metrics collection from a PostgreSQL database
- Persistent, queryable time-series data storage 
- Beautiful, customizable dashboards to visualize performance

**Components We'll Deploy:**
1. **PostgreSQL Database**: Our application component generating performance metrics
2. **PostgreSQL Exporter**: Translates database metrics into Prometheus-readable format
3. **Prometheus**: The monitoring backbone that collects, stores, and processes metrics
4. **Grafana**: The visualization layer that transforms raw metrics into actionable insights

**Why This Matters:**
- Detect performance issues before they impact users
- Understand resource utilization for better scaling decisions
- Establish baselines for normal operation to detect anomalies
- Enable data-driven decisions for infrastructure optimization
- Build a foundation for alerts and automated responses

**Production Benefits:**
- Reduced mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) for issues
- Lower mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) when problems occur
- Higher system reliability through proactive monitoring
- Better capacity planning based on historical trends
- Improved security through anomaly detection

By completing this tutorial, you'll understand not just how to deploy a monitoring stack, but how to interpret the collected metrics to make informed decisions about your applications running in Kubernetes.

## Interactive Script for Observability

### [SCENE 1: Introduction] - 30 seconds
[*VISUAL: Smooth fade from GDG logo to split screen setup*]

[*TRANSITION: Use slide-in animation for terminal and editor windows*]

[*VISUAL: GDG HKUST logo should pulse briefly when mentioned*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Start with energy and emphasize the importance of observability]

**YOU:** "Welcome back to our **GDG HKUST** Docker and Kubernetes series! üëã 

In our previous tutorial, we deployed our Todo application to Kubernetes. 

Today, we're adding a critical component for production systems: **Observability**! üîç 

We'll set up **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor a PostgreSQL database running in our Kubernetes cluster. 

This is essential knowledge for running reliable applications in production!" [*gesture: expansive motion showing monitoring importance*]

---

### [SCENE 2: Monitoring Stack Overview] - 1 minute
[*TRANSITION: Slide to clean screen with monitoring architecture diagram*]

[*VISUAL: Animated monitoring components appearing as mentioned*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Use the analogy of a health monitoring system to make monitoring concepts relatable]

**YOU:** "Let's understand what makes up our monitoring stack. Think of it as a health monitoring system for your applications." [*gesture: overview motion*]

**YOU:** "Just like doctors use different instruments to check your health, our monitoring stack has specialized components:"

[*VISUAL: **SLIDES**: Each component appears with animation*]

**YOU:** "
1. **PostgreSQL Database** - This is our application component that we want to monitor. 
   - Think of it as the patient.

2. **PostgreSQL Exporter** - This component collects metrics from PostgreSQL and converts them to a format Prometheus understands. 
   - Like a nurse taking your vital signs.

3. **Prometheus** - This is our time-series database that collects and stores metrics. 
   - Think of it as the hospital's record-keeping system, tracking health metrics over time.

4. **Grafana** - This provides visualization of our metrics through dashboards. 
   - Like the doctor's displays showing heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs in an easy-to-understand format.

Let's set up these components to monitor our database!" [*gesture: transition motion*]

[**ENGAGEMENT QUESTION**: "Why do you think monitoring is considered essential for production systems?"]

---

### [SCENE 3: Setting Up PostgreSQL] - 1 minute
[*TRANSITION: Smooth pan to editor window*]
[*VISUAL: Editor showing postgres.yml with syntax highlighting*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Assume familiarity with Deployment, Service, PVC from Part 3. Focus on *why* we need these for this specific component.]

**YOU:** "First, let's set up our PostgreSQL database. This deployment is similar to the database we used in Part 3, but focused just on providing a target for monitoring." [*gesture: familiar setup*]

*[**SHOW** postgres.yml]*

**YOU:** "Like before, we define a **Deployment** to run the PostgreSQL container, a **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC) for data storage (remember from Part 3 how this keeps data safe?), and a **Service** for internal networking." [*gesture: recalling components*]

**YOU:** "The key difference here is the Service type and name:"

```yaml
# postgres.yml (Service Snippet)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres-service # Important: Exporter will use this name
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: postgres
  type: ClusterIP      # Recall from Part 3: Only accessible *inside* the cluster
```

**YOU:** "We're using `type: ClusterIP`, making it accessible only *within* the cluster, which is good practice for databases. The name `postgres-service` is crucial because our metrics exporter will use this name to connect to the database." [*gesture: pointing to name*]

[**KNOWLEDGE CHECK**: "We have our database running internally. How do we get metrics *out*?"]

---

### [SCENE 4: PostgreSQL Exporter] - 1-2 minutes
[*TRANSITION: Slide to next file*]
[*VISUAL: Editor showing postgres-exporter.yml*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Explain the specific role of this exporter and its configuration.]

**YOU:** "To get metrics from PostgreSQL into Prometheus, we need a translator ‚Äì that's the **PostgreSQL Exporter**. It queries PostgreSQL for metrics and exposes them in a format Prometheus understands." [*gesture: translating motion*]

*[**SHOW** postgres-exporter.yml]*

**YOU:** "This requires its own **Deployment** to run the exporter container and a **Service** so Prometheus can find and 'scrape' it."

**YOU:** "The most critical part of the Deployment configuration is telling the exporter how to find our database:"

```yaml
# postgres-exporter.yml (Deployment Env Snippet)
# ... inside containers: section ...
          env:
            - name: DATA_SOURCE_NAME
              # Tells exporter how to connect to the DB:
              # Format: postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?sslmode=disable
              value: "postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres-service:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
              #                                       ^ Uses the DB Service name!
```

**YOU:** "See how `DATA_SOURCE_NAME` uses the **Service name** `postgres-service` we just defined? That's Kubernetes service discovery linking our exporter to the database!" [*gesture: connection motion*]

**YOU:** "Now, we define the **Service** for the exporter itself, so Prometheus knows where to find *it*:"

```yaml
# postgres-exporter.yml (Service Snippet)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres-exporter-service # Prometheus will target this name
spec:
  selector:
    app: postgres-exporter
  ports:
    - port: 9187          # Standard port for postgres-exporter
      targetPort: 9187    # Port the exporter container listens on
  type: ClusterIP         # Prometheus runs inside the cluster
```

**YOU:** "Prometheus will connect to `postgres-exporter-service` on port `9187` to scrape the metrics. We use ClusterIP because Prometheus also runs inside the cluster." [*gesture: endpoint motion*]

[**ENGAGEMENT QUESTION**: "Exporters are common in Prometheus. What other services might have dedicated exporters? (e.g., Redis, Kafka, web servers)"]

---

### [SCENE 5: Prometheus Configuration] - 2 minutes
[*TRANSITION: Slide to next file*]
[*VISUAL: Editor showing prometheus.yml*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Assume K8s object familiarity. Focus on Prometheus config via ConfigMap.]

**YOU:** "Next: **Prometheus**, the core of our stack. It pulls (or 'scrapes') metrics from targets like our exporter and stores them as time-series data." [*gesture: core component + scraping motion*]

*[**SHOW** prometheus.yml]*

**YOU:** "To run Prometheus in Kubernetes, we need:" [*gesture: listing K8s objects*]
"- A **Deployment** to run the Prometheus server container.
- A **PVC** to store the collected metrics persistently (like in Part 3).
- A **Service** to access the Prometheus web UI.
- A **ConfigMap** to provide Prometheus' *own* configuration."

**YOU:** "Let's look at the Service and the ConfigMap."

```yaml
# prometheus.yml (Service Snippet)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus-service # Grafana will use this name
spec:
  selector:
    app: prometheus
  ports:
    - port: 9090
      targetPort: 9090
  type: LoadBalancer     # Recall Part 3: Makes UI accessible externally
                         # (Needs 'minikube tunnel')
```

**YOU:** "We use `type: LoadBalancer` here, just like our frontend/backend in Part 3, so we can access the Prometheus web UI externally via `minikube tunnel`." [*gesture: external access motion*]

**YOU:** "The **ConfigMap** tells Prometheus *what* to monitor:"

```yaml
# prometheus.yml (ConfigMap Snippet - Scrape Config)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s # How often to scrape targets

    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'prometheus' # Job to scrape Prometheus itself
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9090']

      - job_name: 'postgres' # Job for our database exporter
        static_configs:
          # Tells Prometheus where the exporter Service is:
          - targets: ["postgres-exporter-service:9187"]
          #             ^ Uses the exporter Service name and port!
```

**YOU:** "Inside the `scrape_configs`, we define a `job_name` called 'postgres'. The `targets` list tells Prometheus to connect to our exporter using its Service name, `postgres-exporter-service`, on port `9187`. Prometheus will now automatically find and scrape metrics from our exporter!" [*gesture: configuration + success motion*]

[**KNOWLEDGE CHECK**: "Prometheus is set to collect data. How do we make sense of it? Grafana!"]

---

### [SCENE 6: Grafana Setup] - 2 minutes
[*TRANSITION: Slide to next file*]
[*VISUAL: Editor showing grafana.yml and a glimpse of grafana-configmap.yml*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Focus on Grafana's role and config provisioning via ConfigMaps.]

**YOU:** "Finally, **Grafana**! This takes the raw time-series data from Prometheus and turns it into beautiful, insightful dashboards." [*gesture: visualization motion*]

*[**SHOW** grafana.yml]*

**YOU:** "Grafana also needs standard Kubernetes resources:" [*gesture: listing K8s objects*]
"- A **Deployment** to run the Grafana server.
- A **PVC** to store its configuration and custom dashboards persistently.
- A **Service** to access the Grafana web UI.
- And crucially, **ConfigMaps** to automatically provision datasources and dashboards."

**YOU:** "The Service is again `type: LoadBalancer` for external access:"

```yaml
# grafana.yml (Service Snippet)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: grafana-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: grafana
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer # Recall Part 3: External access via 'minikube tunnel'
```

**YOU:** "The power lies in using ConfigMaps for automatic setup. The Deployment mounts these ConfigMaps as volumes:"

```yaml
# grafana.yml (Deployment Snippet - Volume Mounts)
# ... inside containers: section ...
          volumeMounts:
            - name: grafana-storage # For Grafana's internal state
              mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
            # These mount ConfigMaps for provisioning:
            - name: grafana-datasources        # Mounts the datasource config
              mountPath: /etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources
              readOnly: true
            - name: grafana-dashboards-config # Mounts the dashboard provider config
              mountPath: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards
              readOnly: true
            - name: grafana-dashboards-storage # Mounts the actual dashboard JSON
              mountPath: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/postgres
              readOnly: true
# ... below, volumes: section links names (e.g., grafana-datasources) to ConfigMaps ...
```

**YOU:** "Let's glance at the key ConfigMap that connects Grafana to Prometheus:"

*[**SHOW** a glimpse of grafana-configmap.yml - Datasource part]*

```yaml
# grafana-configmap.yml (Datasource ConfigMap Snippet)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: grafana-datasources
data:
  datasources.yml: |  # Renamed key for clarity
    apiVersion: 1
    datasources:
    - name: Prometheus     # Name shown in Grafana UI
      type: prometheus     # Type of datasource
      access: proxy        # How Grafana connects
      # URL points to Prometheus Service within Kubernetes:
      url: http://prometheus-service:9090
      #         ^ Uses the Prometheus Service name!
      isDefault: true      # Make this the default datasource
      editable: true
```

**YOU:** "This tells Grafana where to find Prometheus, using its Kubernetes **Service name** `prometheus-service`. We also have another large ConfigMap (`grafana-dashboards-storage`) containing the JSON definition for a pre-built PostgreSQL dashboard. Grafana reads these on startup - no manual config needed!" [*gesture: automatic setup*]

[**ENGAGEMENT QUESTION**: "What's the benefit of defining dashboards and datasources 'as code' in ConfigMaps? (Hint: Version control, consistency)"]

---

### [SCENE 7: Deploying the Monitoring Stack] - 1 minute
[*TRANSITION: Pan to terminal window*]
[*VISUAL: Clean terminal with command prompt*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Keep deployment steps concise, assuming familiarity from Part 3.]

**YOU:** "With all manifests ready, let's deploy the entire stack!" [*gesture: deployment motion*]

*[**RUN COMMAND**]*
```bash
kubectl apply -f .
```

**YOU:** "Just like in Part 3, `kubectl apply -f .` creates or updates all the resources defined in our YAML files. Let's quickly check the pods:" [*gesture: checking motion*]

*[**RUN COMMAND**]*
```bash
kubectl get pods -w # Use -w to watch status changes
```
*(Wait for all pods: postgres, postgres-exporter, prometheus, grafana to be Running)*
**(Press Ctrl+C to stop watching)**

**YOU:** "Looks good! Now, remember from Part 3, our Prometheus and Grafana Services use `type: LoadBalancer`. To access them locally via Minikube, we need:" [*gesture: recalling tunnel*]

*[**RUN COMMAND** in a new terminal window]*
```bash
minikube tunnel
```
*(Enter password if prompted)*

**YOU:** "With the tunnel running, let's get the service IPs:" [*gesture: IP check*]

*[**RUN COMMAND**]*
```bash
kubectl get services
```

**YOU:** "We should see EXTERNAL-IP addresses listed for `prometheus-service` (port 9090) and `grafana-service` (port 3000). Let's explore!" [*gesture: transition to exploration*]

---

### [SCENE 8: Exploring Prometheus] - 1-2 minutes
[*TRANSITION: Smooth pan to browser window*]
[*VISUAL: Browser navigating to Prometheus UI (using EXTERNAL-IP or localhost:9090)*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Quick tour focusing on scrape targets and one example query.]

**YOU:** "Let's open Prometheus using its IP and port 9090. First, navigate to **Status > Targets**." [*gesture: presenting UI*]

*[**NAVIGATE** to Status > Targets]*

**YOU:** "Excellent! We see our 'postgres' job, and the state is **UP**. This confirms Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from our exporter." [*gesture: checking status*]

*[**NAVIGATE** to Graph]*

**YOU:** "Now let's run a quick PromQL query. Try `pg_stat_activity_count` to see active database connections." [*gesture: typing query*]

*[**TYPE** query and Execute]*

**YOU:** "We get a graph showing the connection count over time. Prometheus holds all the raw data, but Grafana makes it easier to visualize." [*gesture: showing results*]

[**KNOWLEDGE CHECK**: "Prometheus confirms data collection. Now for visualization."]

---

### [SCENE 9: Exploring Grafana Dashboards] - 1-2 minutes
[*TRANSITION: Switch to Grafana tab in browser*]
[*VISUAL: Browser navigating to Grafana UI (using EXTERNAL-IP or localhost:3000)*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Focus on the pre-configured dashboard.]

**YOU:** "Now, navigate to Grafana using its IP and port 3000. Login with **admin/admin** (you can skip the password change for the demo)." [*gesture: login motion*]

*[**LOGIN** and navigate to Dashboards > Browse]*

**YOU:** "Because we used ConfigMaps for provisioning, our Prometheus datasource is already configured, and we have a 'PostgreSQL Database' dashboard ready to go under the 'General' folder!" [*gesture: highlighting automation benefit*]

*[**OPEN** the PostgreSQL dashboard]*

**YOU:** "Look at this! A rich dashboard visualizing key PostgreSQL metrics like connections, transactions, query performance, cache hit rates, and more - all powered by the data Prometheus is collecting from our exporter." [*gesture: presenting dashboard*]

**YOU:** "This immediate visibility is crucial in production. You can instantly spot trends or anomalies. For example, watch the 'Transactions Per Second' panel - if that drops unexpectedly, you know to investigate." [*gesture: analytical motion*]

**YOU:** "Explore the different panels. This level of insight helps optimize performance and ensure reliability." [*gesture: exploration encouragement*]

[**ENGAGEMENT QUESTION**: "How could a dashboard like this help you troubleshoot a slow application?"]

---

### [SCENE 10: Conclusion] - 30 seconds
[*TRANSITION: Camera view with GDG branding*]
[*VISUAL: Monitoring dashboard with GDG HKUST elements*]

[**PRESENTER NOTE**: Concise wrap-up.]

**YOU:** "And there we have it! üéâ A full observability stack running in Kubernetes, monitoring our PostgreSQL database using Prometheus and Grafana." [*gesture: accomplished motion*]

**YOU:** "Today we saw how to:
- **Deploy** specialized components like exporters.
- **Configure** Prometheus to scrape targets using ConfigMaps.
- **Provision** Grafana datasources and dashboards automatically." [*gesture: summarizing motion*]

**YOU:** "Observability isn't just graphs; it's understanding your system's health and performance. This is essential for reliable, production-ready applications." [*gesture: importance motion*]

**YOU:** "Thanks for joining this **GDG HKUST** tutorial! Keep exploring, keep building!" [*gesture: friendly wave*]

[**FINAL KNOWLEDGE CHECK**: "We've built upon our Kubernetes deployment skills from Part 3 by adding a vital observability layer."]
