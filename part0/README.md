# Part 0: Introduction to the GDG HKUST Docker & Kubernetes Series

This introductory part sets the stage for our practical, hands-on Docker and Kubernetes tutorial series. We explain why these tools are essential for modern Software Engineering careers and outline the goals and structure of the upcoming tutorials.

## Why Learn Docker & Kubernetes?

Understanding Docker and Kubernetes is increasingly crucial for Software Engineers today because they:

*   Are **Industry Standards** frequently listed in job requirements.
*   Power modern **Microservice Architectures**.
*   Help bridge Dev & Ops in a **DevOps Culture**.
*   **Boost Workflow** by creating consistent development environments.
*   Are foundational for leveraging **Cloud Platforms** (AWS, Google, Azure).

Learning these tools helps you understand modern software delivery and prepares you for career opportunities.

## What is this Series About?

This series focuses on **practical, hands-on learning**. We will:

1.  **Part 1:** Containerize an application using basic **Docker** commands and concepts.
2.  **Part 2:** Orchestrate multiple containers locally using **Docker Compose**.
3.  **Part 3:** Deploy the application to **Kubernetes** using Minikube, covering Deployments, Services, and Persistence.
4.  **Part 4:** Implement **Observability** using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the Kubernetes deployment.

## Important: Get the Concepts First!

Our series emphasizes *doing*. To get the most out of it, we strongly recommend watching introductory videos on the core concepts / starter videos **before** starting the practical parts.

**Before Part 1 (Docker):** Watch an introduction to Docker concepts.
