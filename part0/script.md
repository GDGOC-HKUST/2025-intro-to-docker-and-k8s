## Interactive Script for Part 0

### [SCENE 1: Welcome & Hook] - (20-30 seconds)
[*VISUAL: GDG HKUST intro animation, then speaker view perhaps with logos overlayed.*]
[*TONE: Energetic, welcoming, enthusiastic.*]

**YOU:** "Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ I\'m [Your Name] from **GDG HKUST**, and we\'re thrilled to kick off our hands-on tutorial series on **Docker and Kubernetes**!"

**YOU:** "If you\'re involved in software development, deployment, or operations, you\'ve likely heard about them. But why are they so important?"

---

### [SCENE 2: The "Why": Why Docker & K8s Matter for Your SWE Career] - (45-60 seconds)
[*VISUAL: Split screen? One side showing job board snippets mentioning Docker/Kubernetes, the other showing logos of companies using them. Or, graphics illustrating points like microservices, cloud platforms, DevOps infinity loop.*]
[*TONE: Direct, career-focused, motivational.*]

**YOU:** "If you\'re aiming for a Software Engineering career today, they aren\'t just \'nice-to-haves\' â€“ they\'re increasingly **essential skills** companies look for."

**YOU:** "Here\'s why:"
*   "**1. Industry Standard:** Docker & K8s are frequently listed in SWE job requirements (backend, platform, full-stack). Companies rely on them to build, ship, and run apps efficiently."
*   "**2. Powers Modern Architectures:** Essential for packaging, deploying, and managing microservices effectively."
*   "**3. Boosts Your Workflow:** Solves the \'it works on my machine\' problem with consistent environments, leading to faster onboarding and less debugging."
*   "**4. Unlocks Cloud Potential:** Foundational for using managed Kubernetes services on major cloud platforms (Google, AWS, Azure)."

**YOU:** "Learning Docker and Kubernetes means understanding **modern software delivery** and positioning yourself for **great career opportunities**. This series gives you that practical, hands-on experience!"

**YOU:** "But before we dive into the hands-on parts, it\'s crucial to grasp the core concepts first."

### [SCENE 3: Getting the Concepts: Recommended Viewing] - (30-45 seconds)
[*VISUAL: Clear display of 2-3 recommended YouTube video links/titles/thumbnails (and maybe QR codes) - *Initially show Docker videos*. Add text like "Pause here or check the description!"*]
[*TONE: Directive, helpful.*]

**YOU:** "Okay, before we jump into the hands-on coding in Part 1, it\'s really important to grasp the basic concepts. Our series focuses heavily on the **practical** side â€“ learning by doing."

**YOU:** "So, to cover the **theory** â€“ the \'what\' and \'why\' â€“ we strongly recommend watching a good introductory video on **Docker** first. Here are a couple of great options:"
**(Show Docker Video Links/Placeholders - Replace with your chosen videos):**
"  - *Docker Explained in 100 Seconds (Fireship)*"
"  - *Docker Tutorial for Beginners (TechWorld with Nana)*"

**YOU:** "Please **pause this video now**, check the links in the description, and watch one of those introductions to Docker. It will make Part 1 much clearer."

**YOU:** "Similarly, before you get to Part 3 on Kubernetes, we recommend these resources for K8s concepts:"
**(Show K8s Video Links/Placeholders - Replace with your chosen videos):**
"  - *Kubernetes Explained in 100 Seconds (Fireship)*"
"  - *Kubernetes Course - Full Beginners Tutorial (freeCodeCamp)*"
"  - *Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners [FULL COURSE in 4 Hours] (TechWorld with Nana) - https://youtu.be/DQdB7wFEygo?si=Epg8IzrPAqKWoi6i*"

**YOU:** "Understanding the theory from these external videos will really help you get the most out of our practical sessions!"

---

### [SCENE 4: Call to Action & Outro] - (20-30 seconds)
[*VISUAL: GDG HKUST branding, speaker view, perhaps end screen with link to Part 1.*]
[*TONE: Encouraging, community-focused.*]

**YOU:** "So, your mission, should you choose to accept it: watch the recommended introductory videos linked below to grasp the \'what\' and \'why\'."

**YOU:** "Then, join us right back here for **Part 1**, where we\'ll dive into the practical world of Docker commands and build our first container image!"

**YOU:** "Thanks for tuning in from all of us at **GDG HKUST**. Let\'s start building! ðŸ‘‹"
