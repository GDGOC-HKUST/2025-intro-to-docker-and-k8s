# Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes

In this workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of containerization and orchestration by deploying a simple web application using Docker, managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose, deploying these applications to a Kubernetes cluster, and setting up observability with Prometheus and Grafana, culminating in the automation of the deployment process using a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how to containerize applications, manage multi-container applications, deploy them to Kubernetes, monitor their health, and automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines.
