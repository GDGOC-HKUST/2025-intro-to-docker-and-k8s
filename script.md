## Understanding the Docker and Kubernetes Tutorial Repository

This repository is structured as a step-by-step tutorial for learning Docker and Kubernetes, divided into multiple parts:

### Repository Structure:
1. **Part 1: Deploying an Application using Docker**
   - Contains a simple Go web server
   - Includes a Dockerfile that shows how to containerize the application
   - Demonstrates basic Docker concepts like image building and container running

2. **Part 2: Deploying Multiple Applications using Docker Compose**
   - Introduces a multi-container setup with frontend, backend, and database
   - Uses docker-compose.yml to define and connect multiple services
   - Shows how to manage environment variables, networks, and volumes

3. **Part 3: Deploying Multiple Applications using Kubernetes**
   - Contains Kubernetes deployment manifests
   - Demonstrates how to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster

4. **Part 4: Observability using Prometheus and Grafana**
   - Focuses on monitoring and observability
   - Includes Kubernetes configurations for Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application

5. **Part 5: CI/CD Pipeline Integration using GitHub Actions**
   - Contains workflow files for GitHub Actions
   - Demonstrates automating the build and deployment process

### Key Components:
- **Dockerfile examples** - Shows how to build container images
- **Docker Compose configurations** - Demonstrates multi-container application management
- **Kubernetes manifests** - Shows how to deploy to Kubernetes clusters and set up monitoring
- **GitHub Actions workflows** - Illustrates CI/CD pipeline setup
- **README files** - Provide explanations and instructions for each part

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning path to understand containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, gradually building complexity from single containers to fully monitored Kubernetes deployments with CI/CD integration.
